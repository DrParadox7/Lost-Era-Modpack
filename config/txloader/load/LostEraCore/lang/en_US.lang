It will eventually flower if it can tolerate its conditions, else it will §9Wilt§r.%n%n§5§nMature%n§rThe final growth stage of a flower, where the flower is fully formed. A Mature flower will breed with surrounding flowers and eventually die if left on the Soil.%n%n§9§nWilting %n§rWilting flowers can be identified by their brown stalks and discoloured petals. This indicate that a flower is on the verge of death due to being in an unsuitable environment.%n%nFlowers can be cut using §lShears§r. This will drop a §a§egermling§r of the flower.%n§8This will increase their age, killing them without a chance to respawn if their age increases beyond their lifespan.§r%n%nIf a wilting flower is not fixed, the flower will §ndie §rand eventually decay, §renriching the soil in the process.

lostera.quest570.name=Transfer Priority
lostera.quest570.desc=Routed pipe networks are networks of pipes, specifically routed pipes, in which each pipe knows the location of every other pipe in the network.%n%nThere are 2 types of routing, being push and pull. The difference between the two is the way that destinations are assigned to items sent out.%n%n§5Push Routing§r%nPush Routing comes into play when an unrouted item is discovered by a routing pipe. That item is passively assigned a destination if it needs one, then relayed to it.%n%nWhen choosing a destination, every single pipe in the network is asked if they want to take the payload. %n%nEach pipe would then check their inventory space, etc. If it can accept it, it will respond with a priority for that item. After all pipes have been checked, the ID of the pipe that responded with the highest priority is written to the payload.%n%nAfterwards, the routed pipe will check to see which direction it should send the item for the quickest delivery time, and relays it. Eventually, the item will end up at the pipe that responded.%n%n§aPull Routing§r%nPull Routing is used when items are needed at a pipe, at which point it literally reaches into a network and pulls it out. Items sent the way are actively assigned a destination.%n%nThe pipe that is pulling §8(also known as requesting)§r will check every Broadcaster Pipe in the network, which are pipes that respond with, instead of a priority like with push routing, a list of items it can provide.%n%nUsing the lists it gets, it calculates a bunch of pairs of broadcasters and pushes. %n%nEach broadcaster §8(normally just one, unless something was crafted, and a bunch of items have to travel multiple places to get the end product)§r is then asked to push the item to the pipe that wanted to pull it.%n%nGenerally, items traveling with pull style routing have higher priorities than others and therefore, move quicker.

# Quest.3405 - Light
lostera.quest3405.name=Light
lostera.quest3405.desc=Light Level doesn't have an impact on environmental stats or plant growth speed, but it's important to note thatsome crop species have varying light level requirements to grow. \n\nHere are some key categories for light levels:\n\n§7§lDark:§r Light levels between 5 and 9\n§lDim:§r Light levels between 9 and 12\n§e§lBright:§r Light levels of 12+\n\nWhile most crops will thrive at anything above Dim light levels, there are exceptions.\n\nFor example most flowers will typically need Bright light levels to grow.

# Quest.3406 - Crop Stats
lostera.quest3406.name=Crop Stats
lostera.quest3406.desc=Each crop has three genetic traits that determine their performance. \nYou can analyze these stats by using the §5Cropnalyzer§r on a crop's seed.\n\nUndomesticated crops usually start with the lowest possible stats. \n\nBut don't worry!\nYou can change these stats by crossbreeding. \n\nBy carefully crossbreeding your best crops and with a bit of luck in the genetic mutation department, you will improve your crop's traits more and more.

# Quest.3407 - §6Gain
lostera.quest3407.name=§6Gain
lostera.quest3407.desc=The Gain stat (§6Ga§r) is responsible for how much a crop can produce. \n\nWhen this stat is higher, the crop tends to yield more produce on average.\n\nFor each point of Gain, increases the base output by §a+3%%§r and increases the chances for additional bonus output by §a+1%%§r.\n\nThis is particularly valuable with high-tier crops because each tier reduces base output by §4-5%%§r*.\n\n§c§nPushing this stat to 24 and beyond, gradually impairs the crop's ability to produce new additional seeds.§r\n\n§8Each point beyond this threshhold decreases the crop's chance at producing new seeds by 5%%.§r\n\nIn other words, while it may yield more, its seed production decreases as a trade-off.\n\n\n§8* Formula for base output (subject to random variance):\n\nBase Output = 0.95^Tier * 1.03^Ga\n

# Quest.3408 - §2Growth
lostera.quest3408.name=§2Growth
lostera.quest3408.desc=The Growth stat (§2Gr§r) controls how fast a crop grows. \n\nThis stat significantly accelerates the crop's natural growth*.\n\nIt also boosts the chance of obtaining new additional seeds when picking the crop fully mature §8(1%% chance per point)§r*.\n\nIncreasing this stat to 16 or higher will also make it more efficient at cross-breeding with other crops, allowing it to do so more rapidly.\n\n§4§nBeware that by pushing this stat to 24 and beyond will cause crops to begin express weed-like behaviours:§r\n\nOnce these crops have grown beyond their first growth stage, they will begin infesting nearby Crop Sticks with weeds, behaving exactly like fully grown weeds but also becoming immune to weed infestations themselves.\n\n\n§8* The growth speed is determined by this formula:\n\nGrowth Speed = Natural Growth x Environmental Modifier x Gr\n§oNatural growth is a random number between 3 and 6.\n\n\n* §lAdditional Seeds Chance§8 = Growth Stage Chance + Gr/100\n\nGrowth Stage Chance:\nStage 1 = 0%%, Stage 2 = 25%%, Stage 3+ = 50%%\n

# Quest.3409 - §3Resistance
lostera.quest3409.name=§3Resistance
lostera.quest3409.desc=The Resistance stat (§3Re§r) determines how well a crop can withstand threats such as infestation, extinction and death.\n\nWhen this stat is higher, the crop exhibits several positive traits:\n\n- Greater at recovering the crop's original seed when picked §8(10%% bonus per point)*§r\n- Increased resistance to weed infestations and trampling\n- Reduced risk of death by hostile environments\n\n§c§nIncreasing this stat to 28 or higher inhibits its effectiveness in cross-breeding with other crops, making it do so more slowly.§r\n\nThis occurs because its heightened resistance to threats interferes with its capacity to interact with other crops effectively.\n\n§8Its genes will pass on just like any other parent, it will simply take longer for the the offspring to sprout on the Cross Stick.\n\n\n* The math for the seed recovery chance depends growth stage, tier and maturity:\n\n-Growth Stage Chance:\nStage 1 = 0%%, Stage 2 = 25%%, Stage 3+ = 50%%\n\n-Tier Reduction:\nFor each tier, the chance is reduced by 80%%.\n\n§nBase Recovery§8 = Growth Stage Chance * (0.8^Tier) * (1.1^Re)\n\n-Maturity Impact: \nThe success rate is influenced by the crop's maturity (ripe to harvest).\n\n§nPremature Recovery Chance§8 = Base Recovery * 1.5\n§nMature Recovery Chance§8 = (Base Recovery + 1) * 0.8
